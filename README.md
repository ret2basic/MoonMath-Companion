MoonMath Manual (MMM) notes, exercise solution and extra comments.

# To make your life easier

Tbh MMM is pretty dense. You probably want some reference materials to study in parallel.

In general, you can read [RareSkills ZK Book](https://www.rareskills.io/zk-book) in parallel. This book does not assume math background and only explains the ZK ideas.

For specific chapters:

- MMM chapter 4: You might need to look up concepts in [AATA](http://abstract.ups.edu/aata/aata.html) to understand everything. It also comes with sage exercises that you can play with.
- MMM chapter 5: If the elliptic curve math is overwhelming to you, I recommend reading **"Modern Cryptography and Elliptic Curves: A Beginner's Guide" by Shemanske**. This book explains the motivation behind each concept very well and it helps you review some number theory.

# If you want to study more

MMM gives you good math foundation, but it is too short to teach you everything to a level that you are comfortable reading ZK literature. You need extra study.

First of all, you need to know theoretical computer science concepts. I recommend reading **"Introduction to the Theory of Computation" by Sipser** and solving exercises in chapter 7,8,9,10.

Next, you probably want to study a grad-level cryptography course. **MIT 6.875** can be a good choice. The latest course material is [here](http://mit6875.org/) and there is a previous course recording on [Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6ogFv-ieghe8MOIcpD6UDtdK-UMHG8oH&si=DPqKr-lG2DRfirvh).
